## Prerequisites

- You should bring your own laptop with an installed SSH client, to enable
  login to Sigma2 resources.
- You will need an account on the Sigma2 HPC Betzy and storage server Nird to
  work with NorESM. If you do not already have access to these systems, we
  can arrange access before the meeting.
- You should be able to navigate the file tree in a terminal session and edit
  text files in the terminal.
