## Course goals

The goal of the coars is that the participants should be able to set up and
run NorESM experiments, run standard diagnostics on the model output, and 
learn how to contribute to the NorESM model system and supporting infrastructure.


## Audience

The workshop is intended for Ph.D students, postdocs and scientists who are interested in executing model simulations and learning more about technical aspects around it.

The workshop is sponsored by CHESS. If you join the workshop as a CHESS student, please indicate this in the registration form.


## Prerequisites

- You should bring your own laptop with an installed SSH client, to enable
  login to Sigma2 resources.
