## Course goals

The goal of the coars is that the participants should be able to set up and
run NorESM experiments, run standard diagnostics on the model output, and 
learn how to contribute to the NorESM model system and supporting infrastructure.


## Audience

The workshop is intended for Ph.D students, postdocs and scientists who are interested in executing model simulations and learning more about technical aspects around it.


## Prerequisites

- You should bring your own laptop with an installed SSH client, to enable
  login to Sigma2 resources.
- You will need an account on the Sigma2 HPC Betzy and storage server Nird to
  work with NorESM. If you do not already have access to these systems, we
  can arrange access before the meeting.
- You should be able to navigate the file tree in a terminal session and edit
  text files in the terminal.
